# R scripts for analyzing detection and quantification results of dengue virus from one-step reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR).
This repository contains R scripts used for generating results and figures in the manuscript, "Application of One-Step Reverse Transcription-Droplet Digital PCR for Dengue Virus Detection and Quantification in Clinical Specimens" by Mairiang D <i>et al.</i>

## SenseSpec.R
This script is for determining the lower limit of detection (LLOD95) and the lower limit of quantifiction (LLOQ) of RT-ddPCR in measuring dengue virus.
