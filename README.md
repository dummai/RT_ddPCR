# R scripts for analyzing detection and quantification results of dengue virus (DENV) from one-step reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR).
This repository contains R scripts used for generating results and figures in the manuscript, "Application of One-Step Reverse Transcription-Droplet Digital PCR for Dengue Virus Detection and Quantification in Clinical Specimens" by Mairiang D <i>et al.</i>

## SenseSpec.R
This script is used for determining the lower limit of detection (LLOD95) and the lower limit of quantifiction (LLOQ) of RT-ddPCR in measuring DENV. <b>Figure 3</b> was produced by this script.

## Intralab_qRTPCR_v_ddPCR.R
This script is used for evaluating the DENV quantification agreement between qRT-PCR and RT-ddPCR. <b>Figure 4</b>, <b>Figure A3</b> and <b>Figure A4</b> were produced by this script.

## Interlab_ddPCR.R
This script is used for evaluating the DENV quantification agreement of RT-ddPCR performed independently in three laboratories using the identical protocol. <b>Figure 5</b> and <b>Figure 6</b> were produced by this script.

## Interlab_qRTPCR.R
This script is used for evaluating the DENV quantification agreement of qRT-PCR performed independently in two laboratories using two different protocols. <b>Figure S4</b> was produced by this script.

## ViralLoad_v_Severity.R
This script is used for evaluate the correlation between DENV levels and disease severity. <b>Figure S5</b> was produced by this script.
